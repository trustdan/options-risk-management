### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Date Handling in JavaScript/Go Applications
When working with dates between JavaScript frontend and Go backend:

1. **ISO String Format**: Always convert JavaScript Date objects to ISO strings before sending to Go:
   ```javascript
   // Correct way to send dates to Go backend
   const dateStr = new Date(date).toISOString().split('T')[0];
   const formattedDate = `${dateStr}T00:00:00Z`; // Use complete ISO format
   ```

2. **Date Comparison**: When comparing dates, convert both to the same format first:
   ```javascript
   // Convert both dates to YYYY-MM-DD format before comparing
   const date1 = new Date(firstDate).toISOString().split('T')[0];
   const date2 = new Date(secondDate).toISOString().split('T')[0];
   const datesMatch = date1 === date2;
   ```

3. **Using Wails Models**: When using generated model classes, create objects with `createFrom()`:
   ```javascript
   import { models } from '../wailsjs/go/models';
   
   // Create data object
   const ratingData = {
     id: existingRating ? existingRating.id : '',
     date: formattedDate, // ISO string, not Date object
     // other properties...
   };
   
   // Create proper model instance
   const ratingToSave = models.StockRating.createFrom(ratingData);
   
   // Send to backend
   await SaveStockRating(ratingToSave);
   ```

These solutions address common issues with time.Time unmarshalling errors in Go and date comparison mismatches in JavaScript.
